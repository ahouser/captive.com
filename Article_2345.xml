        Senate.<br /> <br /> HB 1700 was recently considered in public hearing by the
        Texas House Insurance Committee.&amp;nbsp;Josh Magden, Texas Captive Insurance Association
        (TxCIA)&amp;nbsp;board president, testified at the hearing in favor of the bill.<br />
        <br /> SB 667 received unanimous support in the Texas Senate Business and Commerce
        Committee&amp;nbsp;for being&amp;nbsp;placed on&amp;nbsp;the Local and Uncontested
        Calendar.<br /> <br /> Both HB 1700 and&amp;nbsp;SB 667:</p> <ol>
        <li>Provide reinsurance pooling as an option to allow captives to introduce
        third-party risk to insure deductibility of premium</li> <li>Give discretion to
        the Texas Department of Insurance (TDI) in determining when credit for reinsurance will be
        granted</li> <li>Require the TDI be given notice when a captive declares
        dividends</li> </ol> <p>Assuming SB 667 passes the Senate, the bill will
        go to the House and be referred to House Insurance where HB 1700 is pending.&amp;nbsp;TxCIA
        representatives have said there may be the opportunity to introduce a House committee
        substitute for SB 667 in House Insurance, provided language can be worked out to expand
        credit for reinsurance to commercial reinsurers, authorize reciprocals, transfer
        incorporation of captives from the Secretary of State's Office to the Department of
        Insurance, and finally clarify some investment options for captives.<br /> <br
