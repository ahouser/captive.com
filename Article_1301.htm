        and CEO of <a
        href="https://www.captive.com/art-market/sponsors/profiles/strategic-risk-solutions-(srs)">Strategic
        Risk Solutions (SRS) captive management firm</a>, and asked him to share his views on
        the captive industry. Read his comments concerning captive growth in Europe and Asia and his
        thoughts on talent acquisition.<br /> <br /> <strong>You've been involved
        in the alternative market space for a long time.&amp;nbsp;What led you to specialize in
        captives, and why did you decide to form <a
        href="https://www.captive.com/art-market/sponsors/profiles/strategic-risk-solutions-(srs)">SRS</a>?</strong></p>
        <p>The appeal of launching SRS was as much about wanting to control my own destiny and
        not work for a big company anymore.<br /> <br /> SRS started life as a broader
        alternative risk business within Arkwright Mutual and then Winterthur/Credit Suisse. The key
        moment in the conversion to what the company is today was in May 2002, when Credit Suisse
        told us that they were shutting down SRS.&amp;nbsp;I asked if I could buy the platform, and
        they agreed. So,&amp;nbsp;3 months later&amp;mdash;the same day my employment
        ended&amp;mdash;SRS, the pure play captive management firm, was born.</p> <p>I
        believe the subsequent success speaks to the entrepreneurial power of backing yourself and
        putting the control in the hands of the people who can most influence the
        result&amp;mdash;our employee shareholders. Our timing was also good, and we had some
        luck!</p> <p><strong>Given your long association with captive insurance,
        what has most surprised you over the last 30 years in the captive
        arena?&amp;nbsp;Conversely, what have you been least surprised
        about?</strong></p> <p>I continue to be surprised (in a positive way!) at
        how captive use continues to evolve to solve different risk issues and add value to captive
        owners.&amp;nbsp;Captives have gone from being used in the "old days" for reinsuring
        property risks, to shifting in recent years to primary casualty risks, and
        now&amp;nbsp;enterprise risks of all types, including employee benefits, cyber, and
        terrorism, to name a few.&amp;nbsp;Captives are the ultimate utility tool&amp;mdash;being
        part of the solution to a wide range of risk financing issues.</p> <p>I have not
        been surprised that the major brokers continue to dominate the Fortune 1000 captive
        management market.&amp;nbsp;Thankfully, this is slowly changing, as younger people come into
        the business and are more open minded and willing to challenge the status quo. Inertia is a
        powerful force!</p> <p><strong><a
        href="https://www.captive.com/art-market/sponsors/profiles/strategic-risk-solutions-(srs)">SRS</a>
        has made a number of announcements concerning its European operations. Do you view the
        European captive market as more likely for expansion than the US market?&amp;nbsp;If so,
        why? Or if not, why not?</strong></p> <p>Like North America, the European
        captive market is mature, and as such I see slow growth in terms of new
        formations.&amp;nbsp;That being said, there are some very large and sophisticated European
        captive owners that are innovative and need partners that can help them achieve goals that
        don't have inherent conflicts of interest.</p> <p>For that reason, we are
        excited about our growth prospects in Europe as we think our model of offering value-added
        consulting along with solid domicile and administrative support will be well
        received.&amp;nbsp;We also think our independence will be more highly valued in Europe in
        the future.</p> <p><strong>Along those same lines, what are your views on
        the Asian captive markets, particularly China?&amp;nbsp;Without giving away any strategic
        plans, do you see SRS expanding in these markets as well?</strong></p>
        <p>Multinational companies, regardless of the origin of the parent company, need
        captives to help them optimize their global risk financing strategies.&amp;nbsp;Just as we
        have seen interest from other countries outside the United States, I expect Chinese
        companies and other companies based throughout Asia will want one (or more) captives to
        support their growing global operations and risk footprint.&amp;nbsp;SRS will look for
        opportunities to partner with these companies and find the best ways to be in those
        domiciles where quality companies want to locate their captives.</p>
        <p><strong>As a captive manager, what do you think are the most salient
        attributes for managers?&amp;nbsp;And a corollary question: How has the role of the captive
        manager evolved over the last 30 years?</strong></p> <p>The most important
        attributes captive managers need are responsiveness and consistency in meeting the
        ever-changing needs of their clients.&amp;nbsp;Clients want to know that the day-to-day
        operations of their captives are under control but also want a partner they can trust to
        give them unbiased and thoughtful advice when issues or problems come up.&amp;nbsp;
        </p> <p>There can be no organizational barriers that make it difficult for
        captive management staff, those in the trenches doing the work on a day-to-day basis, to be
        able to focus on clients and deliver consistently excellent service.</p> <p>In
        terms of how a captive manager's role has changed, it has become more strategic and less
        tactical for many of our clients.&amp;nbsp;They expect us to suggest new ideas and keep them
        informed of best practices that can be applied to their captive operations.&amp;nbsp;
        </p> <p><strong>We've written about what we've termed the "war for
        talent."&amp;nbsp;What are your views on the ability to attract and retain key professionals
        in today's environment?&amp;nbsp;Also, have you changed anything about SRS's culture in
        order to make it more attractive to millennials?</strong></p> <p>We have
        done quite well over the past 10 years in attracting talent, as many captive professionals
        like the fact we are a "pure play" captive management firm.&amp;nbsp;Our focus is 100
        percent on one business and trying to improve it, which I think is attractive to many
        employees who find it hard to relate to the goals or mission of larger employers doing a
        wide range of things.</p> <p>Our culture continues to evolve and reflects the
        eclectic mix of personalities and cultures that have been attracted to SRS.&amp;nbsp;It's a
        great place, in my view, for younger people new to the industry to learn and grow at
        whatever pace they want.&amp;nbsp;That is not new&amp;mdash;it's been that way since the
        beginning.</p> <p><strong>We've talked about the past; let's switch gears
        and talk about the future.&amp;nbsp;How do you see captives evolving over the next
        10&amp;ndash;15 years?&amp;nbsp;Are there specific lines of business that you think are well
        suited for captives?</strong></p> <p>I&amp;nbsp;see captives evolving in
        the future to be more of an offensive tool to support overall corporate strategies to serve
        customers and generate incremental profits.&amp;nbsp;I also think captives can and will do
        more to reduce organizations' overall cost of risk and squeeze out more of the
        inefficiencies of the traditional commercial insurance market where non-loss costs are still
        over 35 percent.&amp;nbsp; </p> <p>In terms of specific lines of business or
        growth areas, captives will help solve the mismatch between the demands of companies and
        industries that have new risks and service models where traditional insurers struggle to
        provide the needed solutions.&amp;nbsp; </p> <p><strong>In talking with
        your clients, what are the issues that keep them awake at night?</strong></p>
        <p>Fortunately, very few of them are captive specific, although some of the issues
        create potential opportunities for us to be part of the solution.&amp;nbsp;For example, the
        ongoing challenges with health insurance are a major concern for those that employ large
        numbers of staff.&amp;nbsp;Cyber and terrorism are two others where no one can ever get too
        complacent given the world we live in today.</p> <p><strong>Any advice you
        would offer current risk management graduates concerning the captive insurance market and
        why they should consider a career here?</strong></p> <p>It's a great
        business to be in&amp;mdash;helping clients solve problems and issues that constantly change
        and vary from client to client.&amp;nbsp;It's never boring, and there are tremendous growth
        opportunities as people like me will be retiring at some point, and we need the next
        generation to step up and take our industry to the next level.</p>
        <p><strong>Any closing thoughts or comments that you would like to share with
        our readers?</strong></p> <p>Focus on the clients and take care of your
        people, and the rest will take care of itself!</p> <p><strong>Thanks,
