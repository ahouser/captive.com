        captive feasibility studies that, of necessity, rely on a substantial amount of data
        provided by the would-be captive parent.<br /> <br /> "One often hears that
        actuaries should be given 5 years of loss data to use in a captive feasibility analysis,"
        said Milliman's Mike Meehan during a session on captive feasibility studies at the
        2015&amp;nbsp;Cayman Captive Forum. "But 5 years should only be considered a
        minimum."</p> <p> Five years of data is good, but not great, he explained. The
        less data provided to the actuary, the more the actuary will have to rely on industry data.
        This issue becomes particularly important with long-tail liability lines of coverage. When
        provided with 10 or more&amp;nbsp;years&amp;nbsp;of data, on the other hand, the actuary
        will be increasingly able to base the analysis on the captive parent's actual experience
        rather than on industry averages. This will result in a more objective, realistic, and
        credible feasibility study.<br /> <br /> <em>Pictured above&amp;nbsp;from
