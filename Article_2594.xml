        annual&amp;nbsp;Global&amp;nbsp;Reinsurance&amp;nbsp;Highlights" publication to coincide
        with the 2014&amp;nbsp;Reinsurance&amp;nbsp;Rendez-Vous. It will provide a detailed
        perspective on the market, focusing on the competitive pressures that will
        impede&amp;nbsp;reinsurers'&amp;nbsp;ability to generate strong returns, and challenges for
        the sector to reinforce its relevance to existing and future clients as the global economy
        continues to evolve. <p><span style="line-height: 1.5;"><br /> The article
        "Regional&amp;nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.5;">Reinsurers<span
        style="line-height: 1.5;">&amp;nbsp;In Asia-Pacific Are More Resilient To Industry
        Headwinds Than In CEEMEA," published this week offers an element of the overall picture to
        be provided in the publication by offering a view of how differences between
        regional&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurance<span style="line-height:

        global&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurers<span style="line-height: 1.5;">&amp;nbsp;enjoy
        dominant positions in the major markets of Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and
        Africa (CEEMEA). This leaves smaller regional&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurers<span
        style="line-height: 1.5;">&amp;nbsp;in these regions in a precarious position and at risk
        of being further marginalized. By contrast, in the Asia-Pacific
        region,&amp;nbsp;</span><span style="line-height:
        1.5;">local&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurers<span style="line-height:
        1.5;">&amp;nbsp;have significant market shares, giving them better established and more
        defensible competitive positions. Standard &amp;amp; Poor's considers that
        Asia-Pacific&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurers<span style="line-height:
        1.5;">&amp;nbsp;are better positioned to withstand global competitive pressures such as
        increasing&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurance<span style="line-height:

        ratings on regional&amp;nbsp;</span>reinsurers<span style="line-height:
