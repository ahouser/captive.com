        <em>CICR</em></strong></p> <ul> <li> Troy LePage, the
        director of internal audit and enterprise compliance at HAI Group, a captive insurer serving
        the affordable housing industry, answers some commonly asked questions and provides critical
        points to consider around incorporating an internal audit function into an overall corporate
        governance program. He says that by establishing an internal audit function, captive
        insurers can make every area of their business more effective, efficient, and
        accurate.</li> <li><a

        Pierce, senior director with Kroll Bond Rating Agency</a>, delves into corporate
        governance in the credit rating process and says that governance is an art, not an exact
        science, and vigilance at staying on top of good governance practices is key to remaining
        out of the headlines for transgressions. </li> <li>Independent consultant Dawne
        Ware reviews the benefits of the independent director on captive boards. She says having an
        independent director on your board is considered a "best practice" in corporate governance,
        and the reasons are compelling.</li> <li>Ben Whitehouse, senior counsel with
        Butler Snow, LLP, in Nashville, discusses a number of salient points that should be the
        feature of any captive insurance program, regardless of size. He says sound corporate
        governance will help keep your captive in good standing with the regulator and can identify
        problems before they become serious.</li> <li> Captive Insurance Companies
        Association President Dan Towle focuses on how his organization is working to meet the
        challenges of dynamic change in the captive insurance industry. He says many emerging
        professionals have not had the opportunity to participate in internships, mentorships, and
        risk management and insurance curricula. This reality is being exacerbated by the
        accelerating rate of retirements of current professionals, emerging technologies, and
        operational transformations.</li> <li>P. Bruce Wright and Saren Goldner of
        Eversheds Sutherland dig into the details related to the <a
