        Bermuda's Captive Hall of Fame, which was begun in 2016. The four captives join a group of
        more than 200 Bermuda-based companies that have been honored for their 25-year commitment to
        the Bermuda insurance market.<br /> <br /> The latest group of inductees were
        established in Bermuda in 1994 and include Fairtide Insurance, Iboba Insurance, Pitts Bay
        Insurance Company, and Trimark Insurance.<br /> <br /> The four insurers will be
        celebrated at this year's Bermuda Captive Conference set for June 10&amp;ndash;12.</p>
        <p>"We salute these companies and their long-standing commitment to our market," said
        Conference Chair Mike Parrish. "They join an impressive group of captive entities
        representing worldwide corporations that have chosen Bermuda for its innovation, reputation,
        and world-class regulation and expertise. Our Captive Hall of Fame is a testament to the
        evolution of our market."<br /> <br /> Close to 800 delegates are expected at
        next week's event, which is Bermuda's 15th captive conference and will host captive
        insurance owners, risk managers, captive managers, sponsors, and vendors from the United
        States, Canada, Latin America, and the United Kingdom.<br /> <br /> As the
        largest captive domicile in the world, Bermuda is home to over 700 captive insurance
        companies supporting primarily Fortune 500 corporations in the United States and generating
        $40 billion in annual gross written premiums.</p></BodyCopy>
