        </strong>will be presented to<strong> </strong>Jeremy Cox, executive chair
        of the Bermuda Monetary Authority (BMA), at next month's <a
        href="https://www.captive.com/resources/captive-insurance-calendar/2019-bermuda-captive-conference">Bermuda
        Captive Conference</a>, June 10&amp;ndash;12.<br /> <br /> Before joining
        BMA in 2002, Mr. Cox began his career as an auditor and later served as the Bermuda
        government's registrar of companies. Notably, he navigated the BMA through its 2016
        achievement of full equivalence with Europe's Solvency II insurance regulatory regime.
        </p> <p>"Jeremy is a key figure in the Bermuda market for his leadership of the
        BMA during a period when it has won global recognition and respect," said <a
        href="https://www.captive.com/resources/captive-insurance-calendar/2019-bermuda-captive-conference">Conference
        Chair Mike Parrish</a>. "His contributions to both the island's insurance industry and
        other financial services sectors have demonstrated a commitment and vision that not only
        helped the BMA become globally recognised, but, as a result, also strengthened the
        jurisdiction's economic future."</p> <p>The award, launched in 2016, is named in
        honor of Fred Reiss, a pioneering Ohio engineer who conceived of the idea of
        "self-insurance," by which corporations could manage their own risks through a dedicated
        subsidiary. Starting with American steel companies, Mr. Reiss pursued the concept in
        Bermuda, launching the first captive in 1962. The sector recorded exponential growth over
        the next 5 decades, distinguishing Bermuda as the world captive leader and fueling the
        foundation of the island's entire insurance industry.</p> <p>"I am deeply
        touched and honoured to receive the Fred Reiss Lifetime Achievement Award and to be part of
        such a group of talented recipients," said Cox, who will also be the industry <a

        speaker at this year's conference on Wednesday, June 12</a>. </p>
        <p>Bermuda is the top global captive jurisdiction, home to more than 700 captive
        insurance companies supporting primarily Fortune 500 corporations in the United States and
        generating $40 billion in annual gross written premiums. The sector recorded continued
        growth in 2018, registering 19 new entities.</p> <p>&amp;nbsp;</p>
