        coverage. In its nascent evolution, there exists an enormous amount of uncertainty, but
        therein lies the need for risk transfer contracts. Additionally, insurance veterans and
        company owners are terribly ill equipped to even understand the risk, let alone grapple with
        responsible and reasonable underwriting. Our interconnected digital world makes
        communication and education ubiquitous but allows the malevolent to wreak havoc across
        millions of people&amp;rsquo;s lives and businesses. </p> <p>In this <a
        href="http://ww2.cfo.com/governance/2015/03/cyber-risk-shareholder-activism-lead-board-concerns/">CFO.com</a>&amp;nbsp;article,
        Michael Heller explores how board of directors' concerns have moved beyond fiduciary and
        fraudulent monitoring. The new unknown of cyberrisk leads boards' concerns (as well as other
        emerging threats). Less than a quarter of those surveyed felt they were able to monitor and
        manage cyberrisks.</p> <p>In this <a
        href="http://fortune.com/2015/03/20/corporate-hacking/">Fortune.com</a>&amp;nbsp;article,
        Robert Hackett (aptly named) reviews recent polls that show that the majority of firms
        believe they will be hacked in the coming year, while almost three-quarters admitted to
        having fallen victim to a cyberattack last year. As with any new exposure, the data showing
        severities and frequencies of these attacks are still very sparse.&amp;nbsp; </p>
        <p>And, finally, in this <a
        href="http://www.businessinsurance.com/article/20150319/NEWS06/150319791/cyber-coverage-a-double-edged-sword-for-insurance-industry?tags=|75|299|302|329|338">businessinsurance.com</a>&amp;nbsp;write-up,
        Judy Greenwald discusses the pros and cons of cyberliability outlined in a recent Fitch
        Ratings Ltd. Report. On one hand, the emerging exposure presents a real business opportunity
        for existing carriers and start-ups for growth, but the potential for significant losses, or
        so dubbed &amp;ldquo;incalculable threat,&amp;rdquo; makes pricing and underwriting nearly
        impossible. She also brings up the recent suggestion of a federal backstop, akin to the one
        in place for terrorism.&amp;nbsp; Considering the maladies of the federal government and the
        global interconnectedness of the cybercrimes, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem like this idea will
        gain much traction until an &amp;ldquo;incalculable&amp;rdquo; event
        occurs.</p></BodyCopy>
