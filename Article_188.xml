        first-quarter issuance of more than $5 billion, according to data compiled by Artemis.
        Exceeding the $5 billion issuance mark has been a rarity in any quarter, Artemis
        said.</p> <p>The $5.05 billion in new issuance involved 27 deals consisting of
        51 tranches of notes, Artemis said. The first-quarter issuance was up 82 percent from the
        same period in 2019 and was 19 percent higher than the previous first-quarter record set in
        2018.</p> <p>The record-breaking first-quarter issuance saw outstanding
        catastrophe bond and ILS market volume reaching $42.4 billion as the quarter ended,
        according to Artemis. While new sponsors were among the first-quarter issuers, repeat
        sponsors dominated the period, showing continued interest in tapping the capital markets for
        reinsurance and retrocession capacity, Artemis said.</p> <p>Among the perils
        covered by the first-quarter catastrophe bond and ILS transactions were earthquakes, floods,
        windstorms, mortgage insurance risks, and medical benefit claims.</p> <p>
        Artemis noted that $5.5 billion in deals are scheduled to mature in the year's second
        quarter, while the average level of second-quarter issuance is $3.5 billion, suggesting the
        market would need an above-average second quarter if the total market volume was to increase
        from its level at the end of the first quarter. Uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic
        could make that difficult, Artemis said, though market growth should resume once the
        pandemic is under better control.</p></BodyCopy>
