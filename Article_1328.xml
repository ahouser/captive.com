        profession, we must recognize those who came before us," said Mr. Cartwright. "Risk
        management has evolved leaps and bounds from just a decade ago, and that progress is a
        direct result of our predecessors' passion and perseverance.</p> <p>"Today,
        industry professionals have the same opportunity to become trailblazers, increasing
        organizational awareness of risk management's diversity and value. As we work to establish
        our individual legacies, together we will strengthen and solidify the collective legacy of
        the global risk management community."</p> <p>Captive.com readers should note
        that the RIMS annual conference has historically been a good place for companies looking
        into captive formation to shop and make initial contact with a large variety of domicile
        representatives from around the world. It is also one place where a large number of captive
        owners congregate. (Source: <a
